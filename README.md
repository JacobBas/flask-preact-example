# Flask/Preact Linear Regression Example Application

The purpose of this repository is to show off how we can create an analytical web application using the simple tech stack of Flask and Preact.

This is my personally my favorite tech stack for quick prototyping for a few different reasons:

- Quick velocity of code changes due to Python and Preact.
- Low dependency due to Flask being a minimal framework and Preact being delivered through CDN with `htm` allowing for a `JSX` like syntax. Removes the need for costly build processes.
- High level of extensibility due to Flask add-ons and the wide range of Preact/React projects out there.
- Easy conversion to a production ready application.
- Easy integration with database technologies given the ORM SQLAlchemy in Python.
